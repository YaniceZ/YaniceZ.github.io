	<h2>Ruida Zeng - About</h2>
	<p>Hello everyone, I’m Ruida Zeng and I am currently a sophomore at <a href="https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu">Vanderbilt University's School of Engineering</a>. I am majoring in computer science, mathematics, with a minor in electrical engineering. I am originally from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou">Guangzhou, China</a>, but I moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stillwater,_Oklahoma">Stillwater, Oklahoma</a> when I was 12.</p>

	<p>I am extremely passionate about computer science and spend a majority of time studying it, whether if it’s for my CS classes, programming contests, or simply just for fun. To sum it up, I am probably one of the most introverted extroverts you’ll ever met. Outside of schoolwork, I am involved with Asian American Christian Fellowship (AACF), Vanderbilt Quiz Bowl, and Math Club. I am also planning on joining the Greek Life communities in the spring (or next fall). Oh, and I play intramural soccer as well. Overall, I am still a newbie on campus and in Nashville and am still trying to “figure everything out” as I go along, which is indeed very exhilarating.</p>

	<p>If you have anything you would like to know anything about me, or have any questions regarding my website, don’t hesitate to contact me, and I’ll be glad to answer you. Also, do let me know if you enjoy (or don’t enjoy likewise) my website so I know that I’m not just delivering soliloquies to an empty audience.</p>
